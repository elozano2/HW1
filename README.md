This assignment required me to visit an elevator and record myself using it.  
I was then required to find what is right and wrong with the current design  
of the elevator and see if I could come up with a better design. Finally,  
I was required to sketch my design and build a small application that  
shows that design in action. This readme will be slpit based on different criterea  
for each letter grade.

While this elevator has some good design, there were a few things I found problematic.
